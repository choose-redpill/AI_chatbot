            Solar energy is one of the most suitable renewable energy sources for rural areas in India. 
            Solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity using photovoltaic cells.
            
            Benefits for Rural Areas:
            - Low maintenance requirements
            - Scalable from small home systems to community installations
            - Reduces dependence on grid electricity
            - Can power water pumps, lighting, and small appliances
            - Suitable for remote locations
            
            Types of Solar Systems:
            1. Grid-tied systems: Connected to the main electricity grid
            2. Off-grid systems: Independent systems with battery storage
            3. Hybrid systems: Combination of grid-tied and off-grid
            
            Cost Information:
